# Benedick Ferrer — Video Editing Portfolio

This is a minimal static portfolio site you can host on GitHub Pages. It includes a showreel player and a thumbnail gallery. Replace the sample videos and posters in `assets/media/` with your own.

How to use

1. Add your video files and poster images to `assets/media/`.
2. Edit `assets/js/main.js` — update the `showreels` array with your titles, descriptions, file names, and tools used.
3. Push to a GitHub repository. In repository settings, enable GitHub Pages from the `main` branch (root) or use the `gh-pages` branch.

Notes

- Keep video files optimized for web (H.264 MP4, ~5-20MB for short clips). Use thumbnails/posters for faster loading.
- For private or large videos, consider hosting on Vimeo/YouTube and embedding iframe players.
