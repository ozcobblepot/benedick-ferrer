To use the TT Neoris font with this project:

1. Obtain the TT Neoris font files (WOFF2 recommended) and place them into this folder `assets/fonts/`.
   - Recommended filenames used by the stylesheet:
     - `TTNeoris-Regular.woff2`
     - `TTNeoris-Bold.woff2`

2. The stylesheet `style.css` includes @font-face rules that will load those files when present.

3. If you don't have TT Neoris, the site will fall back to system fonts automatically.

Licensing note:
- TT Neoris is a commercial font. Ensure you have the appropriate license to include or host it on your site. Alternatively, you can host fonts from an approved webfont service or use a free alternative.
